3) ch branch features
---------------------

add a switch to disable some major decode functionality.
So it's pratically reduced down to parsing only, which would be interressting if you're only interrested in motion vectors.

The switch is the field experimental_mode in the AVCodecContext.
Setting this to 1 skips the ff_h264_hl_decode_mb() function.
Setting this to 2 skips the deblocking filter.

* build - minimalistic

 ./configure --disable-programs --disable-doc --enable-shared --disable-static --disable-decoders --disable-encoders --enable-decoder=h264 --disable-muxers --disable-demuxers --enable-demuxer=h264 --disable-filters --disable-parsers --enable-parser=h264 --disable-debug
 make
 
building on raspberry pi: add a --enable-fft to the ./configure above to get the neon extensions running.
(otherwise it will build, but you can't link it due to undefined references to some neon fft functions)

* impacts on a raspberryPi decoding a 360p videostream(much movement scene)
	increase the fps to nearly 150% from 8.7 to 13.7 by skipping the ff_h264_hl_decode_mb function
	increase the fps to nearly 300% from 8.7 to 26.1 by additionally skipping the deblocking filter
